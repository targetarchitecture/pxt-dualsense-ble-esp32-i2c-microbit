World's First: BBC microbit Control with DualSense!
This repository presents a groundbreaking solution for controlling a BBC microbit with a PlayStation 5 DualSense controller. Here's what makes it unique:

Pioneering Functionality: This project establishes itself as the first of its kind, enabling the microbit to leverage the advanced features of the DualSense controller.
ESP32 Bridge: The ESP32 Wroom microcontroller equipped with BluePad32 firmware acts as a bridge, seamlessly translating DualSense inputs.
Efficient Communication: I2C protocol facilitates efficient data exchange between the ESP32 and the BBC microbit, ensuring smooth and responsive control.
This project unlocks exciting possibilities for microbit applications in various fields, from robotics and game development to interactive installations.
